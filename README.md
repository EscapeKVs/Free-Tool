# Free-Tool
This tool was made by R34s, also known as sbmd_r34s. 
He is the main creator of this tool and has said in his own words "This is a open source tool". 
Which means I will be releasing it on github, You can use it how ever you want, 
but it would be great if you could leave some credits.. 
Thanks for checking this out and have a wonderful day!
